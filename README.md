## 💼 What I Do (Professionally)

I specialize in architecting, building, and managing scalable, secure, and highly available **cloud-native infrastructure**—with over **20 years of experience** across **Linux/Unix systems**, **AWS**, **Kubernetes**, and **DevOps automation**.

- ☁️ **Cloud**: AWS (primary), GCP, Azure (learning)
- 🧱 **IaC**: Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK
- 📦 **Containers & K8s**: Sidecar patterns, observability, scale to 1M+ pods
- ⚙️ **CI/CD & GitOps**: Jenkins, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, GitLab
- 🔭 **Observability**: Splunk, Prometheus, ELS Stack, Wavefront dashboards, alerts, and integrations with K8s
- 🔐 **HA/DR**: Veritas clustering, SAN replication, zero-downtime design
- 🛠 **Languages**: Python, Bash, Javascript, Golang (learning), Swift (learning).

🧩 Currently managing infrastructure for a large-scale observability platform, processing over **1.4PB logs per day**, and designing automated workflows for cost, compliance, and reliability at scale.

## 📱 What I Do for Fun (Hobby Projects)

Outside of DevOps, I enjoy building delightful **mobile apps** in my free time.

- 📲 **iOS & Android hobbyist**  
- 🧪 Experimenting with **React Native**, **Swift**, and **Flutter**  
- 🚀 I build small tools, utilities, and productivity apps — mostly to scratch my own itch  
- 🔄 Interested in exploring how mobile clients can interact with cloud-native backends via APIs and serverless
